## Usage
```
 When you start the application, 
it shows you the greeting and 4 sections of the menu, 
it also shows you hints: 
```

>1. To see the list of products of the section, you have to type in the name of that section;
>2. To add the product to your basket press `+` and the name of the product;
>3. To return to the main menu press `M`;
>4. To check the products you've chosen type `Basket`;
>5. To remove the product press `-` and type the name of that product;
>6. To leave the shop press `Exit`.

```
The names of sections and products are case insensitive.
At the end a program sums up the price and shows you total price.
